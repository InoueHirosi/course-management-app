I visualized the progress rate using a progress bar.

Using Livedata, it is synchronized in real time when the progress rate is changed.

Made the favorite status permanent using the Room library.

Avoiding a toggle button that makes it difficult to understand ON/OFF, I made the favorite status clearly visible with a frame around the icon.

Using Fragment, users can edit favorites from all pages of home, bookmark, and progress, and the UI and UX of data filtering are simplified.

I used the rangeSeekBar library to make it easier to enter the progress rate.
